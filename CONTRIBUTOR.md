## 1. **Core Architecture Design**
   - Contributed to the design and implementation of the core architecture for the project, ensuring modularity and scalability.
   - Played a crucial role in establishing the overall system flow and data structures used throughout the project.

## 2. **Development of Python Interpreter**
   - Implemented a simple Python interpreter that supports:
     - Input and output functionality.
     - Assignment operations.
     - Expression evaluation (arithmetic and comparison operations).
     - Control flow with `while` loops and `if/else` statements.
   - Focused on integer-only value support and constrained outputs, adhering to the project's defined scope.

## 3. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Improved the performance of key algorithms used within the interpreter by optimizing the evaluation of arithmetic expressions and logical operations.
   - Streamlined the process for handling control flow structures, resulting in faster execution and reduced computational overhead.

## 4. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Developed and implemented test cases for all major components of the interpreter to ensure correctness and reliability.
   - Led the debugging efforts to resolve critical bugs related to expression parsing and loop termination conditions.

## 5. **Documentation and Code Comments**
   - Authored detailed documentation for the Python interpreter, including an overview of supported features, usage guidelines, and known limitations.
   - Provided in-depth comments in the codebase to improve maintainability and ease of future contributions from other developers.
